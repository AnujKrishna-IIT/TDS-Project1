#1. Data Scraping:
The GitHub API token, along with the Python's pandas library, was used to generate two files namely, users.csv and repositories.csv.

a) users.csv: This file contains detailed information about each user located in Dublin with more than 50 followers.
b) repositories.csv: This file holds data on a total of 28,728 repositories belonging to these users.

#2. Surprising facts on the data analysis:
Increase in the repositories has a positive impact on the followers. A user gets approximately 3 additional users for each repository. And also, the increase in the bio-length increases the number of followers.

#3. Recommendation for Developers:
Developers are encouraged to create more repositories and also to build more informative projects. This attracts more followers and also fosters collaboration and engagement with other developers.
